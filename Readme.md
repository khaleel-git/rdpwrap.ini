# RDP Wrapper Library

## RDP Wrapper Library and .ini File Maintenance

The RDP Wrapper Library allows you to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) functionality on Windows editions that do not support it by default. The library relies on a `.ini` configuration file to control its behavior and supported sources. You can conveniently maintain this `.ini` file to add sources on a daily basis or as needed.

## Features

- Enables RDP on Windows editions that don't natively support it.
- Easy-to-use installation process.
- Compatibility with multiple Windows versions.
- Configurable settings for advanced users.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of the RDP Wrapper Library from the [Releases](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a folder of your choice.
3. Run the `install.bat` script as administrator. This will install and configure the RDP Wrapper Library.
4. Once the installation is complete, you can now establish remote desktop connections to your machine.
5. Update the .ini file with this .ini file: https://github.com/khaleel-git/rdpwrap.ini/blob/master/rdpwrap.ini

## Configuration

You can configure advanced settings by editing the `rdpwrap.ini` file located in the installation directory. This file allows you to customize various aspects of RDP functionality and control sources for your daily updates.

## Known Issues

- Some Windows updates may require updating the RDP Wrapper Library to ensure compatibility.
- Incompatibility with certain security features or applications may impact functionality.
